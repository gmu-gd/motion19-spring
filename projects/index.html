        <h3>Exercises</h3>
        <h4>E0. Gif</h4>
        <p>A simple way to start thinking about motion is through a gif, a short animated image that is controlled through individual frames. Using something interesting that happened over your winter break as inspiration, make a 15 to 30 frame, looping gif.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>January 22</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>January 24</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E1. Literal Type</h4>
        <p>Choose a word and create an animation that reinforces the word's meaning. Do this for a total of 4 words. You can come up with your own word or use any of the words below. The file does not have to loop seamlessly but can if it makes sense.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>transition</li>
          <li>expansion</li>
          <li>migration</li>
          <li>elimination</li>
          <li>repetition</li>
          <li>compression</li>
          <li>disruption</li>
          <li>silence</li>
          <li>softness</li>
          <li>loudness</li>
          <li>heavy</li>
          <li>lightness</li>
          <li>addition</li>
          <li>subtraction</li>
          <li>movement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One animation should be made in Photoshop as an around 30 frame (or more) gif. One animation should be made in InDesign as an around 30 page (or more) document, exported as jpgs, then brought in to After Effects and made into around a 1 second movie. One animation should be made entirely in After Effects and should be around a 1 second movie. The final animation should be made physically and around a second long.</p>
        <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>January 24</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>January 29</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E2. Flip Book</h4>
        <p>A flip book is more or less a physical gif. Images are placed in a sequence that allows a user to flip through them and creat motion from still frames. A flip book is also like a stacked storyboard. Instead of the frames being shown in horizontal sequence they are stacked on top of each other. If we took apart a finished flip book we would have a pretty good storyboard.</p>
        <p>On the first page of your provided, blank flip books draw a circle. On the last page of you flip book draw another circle. The circles could be the same size and in the same place or different sizes in different places. Now create a narrative between that connects those two circles by drawing on all the other pages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>January 29</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>January 31</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E3. Motion and Sound</h4>
        <p>Make a 15 second animation using the layered Illustrator file on Blackboard and some kind of audio. The animation should be 15 seconds long and uploaded to the Vimeo group when you are done.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 7</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>February 12</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E4. Null Objects</h4>
        <p>Find a short audio clip (maybe an line from a speech or song) that would do well in an animation. Create an animation for that type using using null objects.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 12</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>February 14</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E5. Bouncing Ball</h4>
        <p>Make a realistic ball bounce around the screen. The ball should pretend to exist somewhat as a real object and use the sides of the frame as walls. The ball should bounce or interact with those walls at least once on each side. Motions and physics can be exaggerated.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 14</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>February 19</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <h4>P1. A Simple Sequence</h4>
        <p>Working with time most likely is a new concept for you to deal with. Before we get into actually making things move on screen we want to start with what our tools are to plan for motion. You will partner up and pick a simple task. You and your partner will thoroughly document that task through photographs. Perform the same task multiple times taking photos from different angles and at different times. You will then translate that documentation into a series of storyboards and design concept boards for key frames. The storyboards will give you an idea of pacing and order while the concept boards will show the visual language of the finished sequence.</p>
        <p>The fictional, final sequence would have a title slide with the name of the sequence, have around 5 to 15 seconds of action, and have ending credits. Your final deliverables will be a storyboard and several concept boards showing key frames from your sequence.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>January 29</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>January 31</strong> Review Documentation and References</li>
          <li><strong>February 5</strong> Storyboards and Two Directions for Concept Boards</li>
          <li><strong>February 7</strong> Revised Storyboards and Revised Concept Boards</li>
          <li><strong>February 12</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>P2. Four Obstructions</h4>
        <p>Each class you will create a video based on a design concept or principle. The first video will have no obstructions on it, only the time (15 seconds) and size (1080x1080) will be required. During the following classes we will impose a series of obstructions that you will respond to by remaking the original video. The goal is not to find ways to work around the obstructions but to find ways to use the obstructions. The end will be a series of four videos that should be visual different but all feel like a set based on their topic.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of each class we will screen the videos and the top 3 videos in each category will get to choose a limitation for the next video.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1:30 Class Obstructions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Video 1</strong> No obstructions</li>
          <li><strong>Video 2</strong> 5 colors, Must have a dinosaur, 10 transitions, 3 typefaces</li>
          <li><strong>Video 3</strong> </li>
          <li><strong>Video 4</strong> </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>4:30 Class Obstructions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Video 1</strong> No obstructions</li>
          <li><strong>Video 2</strong> 5 colors, Must have a dinosaur, Only outlines/strokes (no fills), Pixel art</li>
          <li><strong>Video 3</strong> </li>
          <li><strong>Video 4</strong> </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each individual video will be submitted through Blackboard before class and the final four videos will be combined into one video and uploaded to Vimeo on the last day. This video should have a title slide before each video listing the obstructions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 12</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>February 14</strong> Video 1 due</li>
          <li><strong>February 19</strong> Video 2 due</li>
          <li><strong>February 21</strong> Video 3 due</li>
          <li><strong>February 26</strong> Video 4 due, combined videos due</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>P3. A Moving Poster</h4>
        <p>Design a moving poster for a future event that is happening on campus. The design must retain the formal elements of a poster, communicate using the traditional rhetoric of a poster, and must scale to fit the portrait format (1080x1920). The choice of movement should feel natural and not distract from the content of the poster. The movement should emphasize the message of the poster not confuse the message.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 19</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>February 21</strong> Event Selected</li>
          <li><strong>February 26</strong> 2 rough drafts and storyboards</li>
          <li><strong>February 28</strong> First digital draft of still poster</li>
          <li><strong>March 5</strong> Review poster in motion</li>
          <li><strong>March 7</strong> Refine poster in motion</li>
          <li><strong>March 26</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>P4. A Title Sequence</h4>
        <p>Design a title sequence for a movie or tv show of your choice. The title sequence should be at minimum around one minute long. The content from the existing title sequence (names, title, studios, etc.) should be used in the new titles.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>March 7</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>March 19&ndash;21</strong> Watch movie or tv show, write down words for title concept, storyboard existing title sequence</li>
          <li><strong>March 26</strong> Review initial concepts and style frames</li>
          <li><strong>March 28</strong> Review refined style frames and initial storyboard</li>
          <li><strong>April 2</strong> Review storyboards</li>
          <li><strong>April 4</strong> Review animatic</li>
          <li><strong>April 9</strong> Review intial video</li>
          <li><strong>April 11</strong> Review refined video</li>
          <li><strong>April 16</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>P5. Type in Motion</h4>
        <p>Make at least a one minute video combining type and audio. Keep in mind that certain aspects of the audio can influence decisions you make while animating the type. Outside shapes, colors, and lines can be use but no pictures or videos. The video should be include the title scene that includes the title for the audio and who made the audio. For example, a song would have a song title and artist name and a movie scene would have the movie title and characters involved.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>April 11</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>April 16</strong> Audio selected and initial storyboards and style frames</li>
