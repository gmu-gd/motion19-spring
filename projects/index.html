        <h3>Exercises</h3>
        <h4>E0. Gif</h4>
        <p>A simple way to start thinking about motion is through a gif, a short animated image that is controlled through individual frames. Using something interesting that happened over your winter break as inspiration, make a 15 to 30 frame, looping gif.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>August 28</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>August 30</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <h4>P1. A Simple Sequence</h4>
        <p>Working with time most likely is a new concept for you to deal with. Before we get into actually making things move on screen we want to start with what our tools are to plan for motion. You will partner up and pick a simple task. You and your partner will thoroughly document that task through photographs, videos, words, or any other ways you might think of. You will then translate that documentation into a series of storyboards and some designed key frames. The storyboards will give you an idea of pacing and order while the key frames will show the visual of the finished sequence.</p>
        <p>The fiction sequence would have a title slide, be around 10 to 15 seconds long, and have ending credits.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>January 29</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>January 31</strong> Review Documentation</li>
          <li><strong>February 5</strong> Storyboards and Key Frames 1</li>
          <li><strong>February 7</strong> Storyboards and Key Frames 2</li>
          <li><strong>February 12</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>P2. Four Obstructions</h4>
        <p>Each class you will create a video based on a design concept or principle. The first video will have no obstructions on it, only the time (15 seconds) and size (1080x1080) will be required. During the following classes we will impose a series of obstructions that you will respond to by remaking the original video. The goal is not to find ways to work around the obstructions but to find ways to use the obstructions. The end will be a series of four videos that should be visual different but all feel like a set based on their topic.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of each class we will screen the videos and the top 3 videos in each category will get to choose a limitation for the next video.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Video 1</strong> No obstructions</li>
          <li><strong>Video 2</strong> </li>
          <li><strong>Video 3</strong> </li>
          <li><strong>Video 4</strong> </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each individual video will be submitted through Blackboard before class and the final four videos will be combined into one video and uploaded to Vimeo on the last day. This video should have a title slide before each video listing the obstructions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 7</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>February 12</strong> Video 1 due</li>
          <li><strong>February 14</strong> Video 2 due</li>
          <li><strong>February 19</strong> Video 3 due</li>
          <li><strong>February 21</strong> Video 4 due, combined videos due</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>P3. A Moving Poster</h4>
        <p>Design a moving poster for a future event that is happening on campus. The design must retain the formal elements of a poster, communicate using the traditional rhetoric of a poster, and must scale to fit the portrait format (1080x1920). The choice of movement should feel natural and not distract from the content of the poster. The movement should emphasize the message of the poster not confuse the message.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>February 19</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>February 21</strong> Event Selected</li>
          <li><strong>February 26</strong> 2 rough drafts and storyboards</li>
          <li><strong>February 28</strong> First digital draft of still poster</li>
          <li><strong>March 5</strong> Review poster in motion</li>
          <li><strong>March 7</strong> Refine poster in motion</li>
          <li><strong>March 26</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>P4. A Title Sequence</h4>
        <p>Design a title sequence for a movie or tv show of your choice. The title sequence should be at minimum around one minute long. The content from the existing title sequence (names, title, studios, etc.) should be used in the new titles.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>March 7</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>March 19&ndash;21</strong> Watch movie or tv show, write down words for title concept, storyboard existing title sequence</li>
          <li><strong>March 26</strong> Review initial concepts and style frames</li>
          <li><strong>March 28</strong> Review refined style frames and initial storyboard</li>
          <li><strong>April 2</strong> Review storyboards</li>
          <li><strong>April 4</strong> Review animatic</li>
          <li><strong>April 9</strong> Review intial video</li>
          <li><strong>April 11</strong> Review refined video</li>
          <li><strong>April 16</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>P5. Type in Motion</h4>
        <p>Make at least a one minute video combining type and audio. Keep in mind that certain aspects of the audio can influence decisions you make while animating the type. Outside shapes, colors, and lines can be use but no pictures or videos. The video should be include the title scene that includes the title for the audio and who made the audio. For example, a song would have a song title and artist name and a movie scene would have the movie title and characters involved.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>April 11</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>April 16</strong> Audio selected and initial storyboards and style frames</li>
          <li><strong>April 18</strong> Work day</li>
          <li><strong>April 23</strong> First draft full draft</li>
          <li><strong>April 25</strong> Work day</li>
          <li><strong>April 30</strong> Refined full draft</li>
          <li><strong>May 2</strong> Due</li>
          <li><strong>May 9</strong> Alternate Due Date</li>
